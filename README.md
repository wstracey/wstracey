- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shiloh (they/he) and I'm a student and multidisciplinary artist mostly based in New York.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in oil painting, performance art, music, fashion/textile design, queer/punk/anarchist zines, astrology, creative writing, stick-and-poking (began learning in February 2022), spirituality (especially dualist religions and non-Abrahamic religions w/ancestral veneration), race/queer/disability justice, and the intersections of art and tech. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code (again)!
